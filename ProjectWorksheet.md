## Project Description

Daily News is an app that displays top headlines based on a keyword search. 

## API

[NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/sources)

**NewsAPI Limitations**

- Request limit for free account: 500 per day
- Issues related to deployment - localhost only for free accounts
